Thesis on:
- Adapting Multi-Layered Models for Indoor RSSI Localization for on the move predictions OR
- Selective AP use for Multi-Layered Models for Indoor RSSI Localization

Currently working on:
- Trilateration
-- Formula programmed, further analysis on performance required

- Machine Learning Model
-- Figured out how to generate a model. Need to look into how to generate a prediction with it.
